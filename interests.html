        <p>I have always had an interest in video games since I was 4 years old, the thought of just a whole other world I can interact with is amazing. This path in video games eventually led me to esports where people can play and compete in games for a living. They can be online tournaments, but for the big ones, you can go on what is called a LAN (Local Area Network) like what you see above. There, gamers of equal skill play together in one server and one area to have zero lag and compete to see who is the best team or player depending if it is a solo game or team game.</p>
        <main><h1><img src="./images/editing.png" alt="me editing a video"></h1></main>
        <p>I also enjoy editing videos a lot, even though it is a recent hobby I hope to keep learning it and add it to my list of skills I have. I use DaVinci Resolve as my editing software as it is very powerful and customizable, it can be overwhelming at first to learn editng, but as with everything it does get easier and a lot of fun once you finish something you're proud of.</p>
        <main><h1><img src="./images/piano.jpg" alt="a piano"></a></h1></main>
        <p>I taught myself how to play piano when I was 14 or 15 and I continue to play it today, although it isn't really a passion per say, it is a nice skill to have just to wow people. I also enjoy all types of music, my top artists right now in no particular order are Juice WRLD, keshi, iann dior, glaive, ericdoa, Joji, Warren Hue, Rich Brian, Lil Uzi Vert, and Playboi Carti</p>
